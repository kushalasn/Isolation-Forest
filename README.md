# Isolation-Forest
The Isolation Forest algorithm is a fast tree-based algorithm for anomaly detection. The algorithm uses the concept of path lengths in binary search trees to assign anomaly scores to each point in a dataset. Not only is the algorithm fast and efficient, but it is also widely accessible thanks to Scikit-learnâ€™s implementation.
